# Document-Management
A project for my class SE113 - Software Testing

This is a Document Management System, which means it can manages and oversees all of its documentaries to and from other organizations and agencies.

The language used for this project is C#.

This application requires SQL Server in order to perform normally.

Some accounts used for log in the application (these are made mainly for testing):

Username - Password - Permissions

admin - 1234 - Managing documents, verifying documents, and managing users

director - 1952 - Managing documents and verifying documents

worker - 012345 - Managing documents only
